# Flask and MongoDB API Project Setup

This README outlines the steps necessary to set up and run the Flask API project connected to MongoDB, for both Windows and macOS environments. 

## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.x.

### Windows

1. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Install Flask-PyMongo**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask-PyMongo
   ```

### macOS

1. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install Flask
   ```

2. **Install Flask-PyMongo**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install Flask-PyMongo
   ```
3 Insatall CORS to enable API calls from another application
   ```bash
   pip install -U flask-cors
   ``
4 Install test packages
   ```bash
pip install pytest Flask-Testing pytest-cov
pip install pytest flask-testing mongomock pytest-cov
pip install --upgrade setuptools

## Running the Project

- Navigate to the project directory and run:
  - Windows: `python run.py`
  - macOS: `python3 run.py`
##To run your tests with pytest and measure the coverage, use the following command:
pytest --cov=myapp unitTests.py

##Checking Coverage
The output from pytest will include a coverage report. If you want a more detailed HTML report, you can generate one with:
pytest --cov=myapp --cov-report html unitTests.py

## MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelisting

**To ensure your application can connect to your MongoDB Atlas database, your IP address must be whitelisted in the Atlas dashboard.**

**After you add your account as a user to the database:**

1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).
2. Navigate to **Network Access** under the **Security** section.
3. Click on **Add IP Address** to add your current IP or **ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE** (less secure).
4. Follow the prompts to complete the process.

**Or ask the owner to whitelist your IP address (easier)**
